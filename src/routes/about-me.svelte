	<p>
		As a fast-learning multipotentialite with two Master's degrees in Design and Computer Science, I
		bring a unique blend of aesthetic sensibility and technical expertise to my work which make me
		an ideal candidate for a software engineering role.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		I have experience developing pixel-perfect interfaces and a deep understanding of UI/UX design
		principles. It is my belief that learning is a lifelong journey, it keeps me pushing beyond my
		boundaries and my interdisciplinary approach allows me to deliver high-quality results that
		exceed expectations.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		I have a background in web development, using the latest technologies such as Svelte framework
		and am experienced in C++. My academic projects in C++ range from developing interactive
		applications using Qt framework to manipulating shaders with OpenGL.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		I believe that innovation comes at the intersection of different fields and that quality is more
		important than quantity. I bring a commitment to excellence and a willingness to explore new
		environments and technologies to everything I do. My goal is to create impactful and unique
		solutions that drive positive change.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-16">
		If you're seeking a highly motivated and creative junior software engineer, I am excited about
		the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals and create products that make a difference.
