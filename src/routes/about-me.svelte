	<p>
		Hello! I am an engineer and designer. I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer
		Science specialized in Interaction, Graphics & Design with a minor in Artificial Intelligence from <a
			href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en">Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		Within my Master's I learn to tackle research from different perspectives: with an explorative
		and practical approach, but also with a scientific approach by following the methods of
		academia. Having a scientific background, this truly resonates with me which is why I apply a
		structured method in all my work.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		I strongly believe that innovation comes at the intersection of different fields, for this
		reason I advocate interdisciplinarity and I keep pushing myself into new environments. Being
		myself a lifelong learner, it is my conviction that there are no limits to learning. As a matter
		of fact, I feel an endless need to learn, improve and evolve.
	</p>
