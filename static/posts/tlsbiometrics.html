<h2>My role</h2>
<p>
	My job as an Experience Design Consultant intern was to work on the conceptualization of
	TLSbiometrics. I worked within team composed of a product manager, another UX designer and a
	handful of developers from my company and the client's company. There is also a UI designer that
	joined us at the end of the conceptualization phase.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The challenge</p>
<h2>Process more visa applicants</h2>
<p>
	Our ultimate goal for the project was to process more visa applicants (TLScontact's customers).
	Until then, TLScontact had not developed their own software to capture biometric data. With time,
	they noticed that the main productivity problem was the biometrics step, particularly because of
	the software, this is why they decided to create their own tailored product.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The research</p>
<h2>Observing the visa agents work</h2>
<p>
	Before jumping on a solution, we had to get accustomed to how the visa agents work. I went in a
	visa application center with two of my teammates to conduct ethnographic research, we needed to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		understand the whole process of visa applications, since the new product will be incorporated in
		an existing environment
	</li>
	<li>verify that the problem comes in fact from the biometrics step</li>
	<li>get into the details and specifics of the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stepping in the shoes of the customers</h2>
<p>
	Even though the customers weren't the users of the product we were designing, I wanted to get in
	their shoes to have a full grasp of the workflow.

<h2>The biometrics step: the most tedious</h2>
<p>
	The observations confirmed that the biometrics step was in fact the one causing the most problems.
	The agents themsleves didn't really seem to like working at this position. Here are a few findings
	from our observations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The agents have so many clicks to do, which increases the risk of mistakes.</li>
	<li>
		They need to manipulate 2 computers at the same time, one to collect the biometric data, and
		another to start and stop the recording of the surveillance camera. Nothing is automatic and it
		happens sometimes that they forget to stop the recording, they end up with a video containing 2
		visa applicants. This being totally unacceptable by governments, the only solution is to redo it
		again.
	</li>
	<li>
		They have to fight against the software many times. For example some people have damaged fingers
		and in this way cannot have perfect fingerprints; however, the software does not accept
		fingerprints under a certain quality, a level that is impossible to achieve with damaged
		fingers. The big problem is that the software does not allow for easy manual overrides.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interviewing the visa agents</h2>
<p>
	To get even more qualitative and quantitative data, we chose to interview our users: the agents. I
	shaped and conducted the interviews with the help of a more experienced designer. We were able to
	confirm what we observed and we discovered many other things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the old software was ugly but more functional</li>
	<li>
		capturing pictures and fingerprints is always faster when it is done manually than automatically
		by the computer
	</li>
	<li>having to scroll makes them lose time</li>
	<li>
		parts of the software are never used but they still have to go through them, which makes them
		lose time
	</li>
</ul>

	alt="Screencapture of an interview where a user shows us the old software"

<p class="subhead">A user showing us the old software during an interview</p>

<p>
	At the end of the interviews, we also showed a proof of concept of TLSbiometrics that was
	previously made by the developers to have their input about it.
</p>
<p>
	I was in charge of gathering all the data and make an empathy map from it. I took into account
	what came out the most from the users, what came less, and I linked all these findings to the
	screens from the proof of concept.

<p class="inter-title">Detailed design</p>
<h2>Keeping what is already known</h2>
<p>
	As the main goal here was to improve the productivity, a strategic choice to keep the design
	pretty similar to the previous softwares was made.
	<br />
	First the users have different levels of confidence with technology, so keeping it similar to what
	they have been used to is better to not lose time by teaching them to use the software. What we
	wanted is for them to be able to use it straight away without any prior training.
	<br />
	Also, TLSbiometrics was going to be implemented in another software called TLSdocuments, that the
	agents already used. We had to fit seamlessly in that software.
</p>

<h2>Wireframing TLSbiometrics</h2>
<p>
	I took the responsibility of designing the wireframes based on all the research that we made. This
	was an iterative process during which I was in contact with the agents. The constraints of the
	project did not allow for time to do usability tests. A choice was made to test
	later after production. As designers we felt the need to include the users as much as possible to
	the design process so we did what we could without testing.
</p>

<p>
	Here are a few wireframes after many iterations.
