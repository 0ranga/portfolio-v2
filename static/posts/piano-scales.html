<h2>My role</h2>
<p>
	This work being a personal one, I led this project from start to finish and was the sole designer.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The challenge</p>
<h2>Remembering the scales instantly</h2>

<p>
	My goal was to make it easier to learn and remember the scales, I wanted to have a tool that
	wouldn't get in the way when practicing, something that could be skimmed with ease.
	<br />My hypothesis was that I could achieve that goal by making my creation visual and compact.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The approach</p>
<h2>Use the visual appearance of the piano as a strength</h2>
<p>
	One thing that anyone can notice when looking at a piano is the pattern that the black and white
	keys form. It is in fact a very visual instrument in opposition to some other ones like the violin
	for instance. I personally use this as a mnemonic device all the time: to remember chords,
	intervals, scale patterns. We might as well make the most of it and use it as a strength. <br />
	This is why it made sense to me that we could use this instead of music notation. Note that I have
	nothing against music theory and music notation, if anything I encourage anyone that wants to
	learn a musical instrument to get a good grasp of those as it enables you to have the tools to
	understand music thoroughly. It is the musician's language.
</p>

<h2>Make up the exercises on your own</h2>
<p>
	When we don't use music sheets, we lose some information: the rhythm, the number of notes, the
	order in which you play them, in other words, you don't have the exercise made up for you. It is
	not a big problem if we omit that information, the rythmic exercises can be easily created by the
	musician. Actually I haven't invented anything here: most of my musician friends (pianists and non
	pianists, teachers and students) make scale exercises themselves. It is not that complicated, you
	can do a lot of things with scales: go up and down an octave or more; go ascending with one hand,
	descending with the other one; start the scale on different notes with each hand, for example a
	tenth apart; you can also go up the scale in thirds (every other notes).
</p>
<p>
	What I am trying to achieve is better visualization and memorization of the scales, not better
	exercises. Music sheets aren't the best means for that.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The constraints</p>
<h2>Fitting dozens of pages of content on a single one</h2>
<p>
	Learning the scales is one of the most fundamental parts of learning a musical instrument. The
	basic ones are the major and minor scales which are the first ones learned by any musician,
	whether you follow a classical or a jazz path.
</p>

<p>The three main challenges for pianists are the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>knowing the notes of each scale; this is usually learned by heart</li>
	<li>
		knowing the fingerings of each scale; in other words: which finger is supposed to go on which
		key to be able to go up and down the keyboard in a fluid movement
	</li>
	<li>
		knowing the key signature that goes with a each scale; this is what you find at the beginning of
		a music sheet, the sharps and flats tells you the scale you are supposed to use for a specific
		song, it is important to identify it.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="subhead">How the fingerings work on the piano</p>

<p>
	In total, there are 24 scales (I am talking about the 24 most common scales, in truth there is a
	lot more than that!), each scale is composed of 7 notes, for each note there is a specific
	fingering. And it can take up a lof of space, here is an example of what a typical exercise looks
	like:

</p>

<p>
	Here you have only two scales, multiply that by 12 and you get 12 pages for 24 scales. <br />All
	this information was supposed to appear on the final production.

<h2>Don't reinvent the wheel</h2>
<p>It is easy to fit a lot of content on one page, it is harder to do it in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>
	I reused the circle of fifths, which is a wonderful tool used by many musicians to have a visual
	representation of all the scales relationships.
</p>

<p>
	The example used above is a very good one as it includes the major scales but also their relative
	minor scales and their key signatures.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">
	If you want to know more about all of that I invite you to look into music theory.
</p>

<h2>Getting users' inputs</h2>
<p>
	I had a few ideas about where I wanted to take this design but I wanted to have users opinions as
	early as possible in the process. I presented the first iterations to some of my friends and
	students, I also chose to post them on
	<a
		href="https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/axzb0h/a_visual_chart_ive_made_to_practice_major_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x"
		>reddit.com/r/piano</a
	>
	to have as many insights as possible.

<p>Along with minor corrections this is what came most from users:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the fingerings should be added</li>
	<li>
		something like a background should be added to make it more readable as some keyboards are not
		directly aligned with the scale names
	</li>
	<li>
		the outermost rim with the keys should contain the major scales instead of the minor ones to
		make it seamless with the central circles where the outermost rim contains the names of the
		major scales
	</li>
	<li>
		a lowercase "m" should be added next to the minor scale letters as it is how they are commonly
		spelled
	</li>
	<li>
		the key signatures should also contain the treble clef (for the left hand) just like it does in
		any piano sheet
	</li>
	<li>printer-friendly color should be used so that anyone can print it with a home printer</li>
	<li>black keys should be darker</li>
	<li>a black and white version would be appreciated as some users were colorblind</li>
</ol>

<p>All these suggestions were taken into account to make the final product.</p>

<p class="inter-title">The refinement</p>
<h2>Making it look better and editable</h2>

<p>
	A little time passed by and I didn't like the poster anymore, I didn't like how it looked
	visually, I didn't like the fact the aspect ratio does not fit on A paper (A4, A3, A2, etc.) and I
	didn't like the fact that it was a pain to edit. In August 2021, I decided to refine the poster,
	make it more appealing and use Figma to do it. I really love that software and I knew I could
	create many components to make it easily editable.

<h2>More than 5,000 views on Archive.org</h2>
<p>
	As I wanted this poster to be available to anyone to view and download, I uploaded it on
	Archive.org, the link can also be found in the wiki of the subreddit r/piano. It reached more than
	5,000 views.

<h2>2,500 upvotes on reddit r/wearethemusicmakers</h2>

	I thought, why not post it on this subreddit too, it was intended for pianists but it sure can
	help producers too.

<h2>17 stars on GitHub</h2>
<p>
	I know that's not a lot! With the new version I created in August 2021, I realized it was probably
	better to put it on GitHub so that I can upload the changes easily, and if anyone wants to open an
	issue or suggest something, there is already a perfect workflow suited on GitHub. Now the only
	problem is tha all pianists aren't familiar with these tools.

<h2>30+ sold posters</h2>
<p>
	This project was not made to make money but many people asked me to release a printed version that
	they could buy, because they would want a music poster to hang on their wall. I thought maybe
	people could buy it from me as a way to support my work instead of printing them themselves. I put
	it on Society6 and on Etsy and reached a little more than 30 sells.

<h2>What I would change if I had to do it again</h2>
<p>
	This project was on of my first try at user centered design, and my workflow was not exactly the
	best. Back then, I did not have the knowledge that I have today about design thinking, I just went
	with the flow and assumed I knew my users because of my own experience and by the observations I
	made teaching the piano.
	<br />
	I think it would have been better if I started by gathering information in a more rigorous way. I
	would have been able to better exploit the data. I would also have spent time on verifying my
	interpretation by observing how people use the poster or conduct interviews (another option was to
	create a survey).
	<br />
	What I did was more like an informal way of getting suggestions from different person that saw the
	poster. Most of them were pianists but I didn't get any information about that, maybe they were music
	producers, they probably had very different levels, maybe some practiced the scales a lot while
	others did not, etc. I could have been more specific and collect demographics data.
	<br />
	Nonetheless, I am happy with how this project turned out, and it taught me a lot as a designer.
