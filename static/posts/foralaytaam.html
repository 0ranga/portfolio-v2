<h2>My role</h2>
<p>
	I had two roles in the team: UX/UI Designer and Web Developer. I was not the only designer in the
	team, we all had to wear several hat for this project. Here is a detail of the composition of the
	team:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Web Editor & Translator</li>
	<li>Web Editor & Translator</li>
	<li>UX/UI Designer & Web Editor</li>
	<li>UI Designer & Translator</li>
	<li><strong>UX/UI Designer & Web Developer â€” me</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>
	Apart from us students we worked in close relationship with the client, who was the head of the
	organization.
</p>

<p class="inter-title">The challenge</p>
<h2>Bringing more visibility to the organization</h2>
<p>
	The main goal of this project was to allow For Al Aytaam to have more visibility thanks to an
	official online platform.
	<br />
	Until then, the organization had never had a website per se. They were active on social media and
	used a paypal account to gather donations but now it was time to do things the right way. The idea
	with the website was to inspire trust to get more donations.
</p>

<h2>A students-only built website</h2>
<p>
	Another goal with this project was to build everything on our own, just the 5 of us students. Of
	course we could go to our teachers when facing a problem but we had to try and do as much as
	possible without any help. It was like having our little company handling the project and the
	problems as well as the communications with the client.

<p class="inter-title">The research</p>
<h2>Getting to know For Al Aytaam</h2>
<p>
	Since the organization was pretty new to us, we had to start by understanding who they are, what
	they do, how they do it... This was done with the help of the client but also a little bit of
	research that we did on our own by looking at the social media of the organization, how they
	communicate, what type of help they provide to orphanages and we did some interesting findings.
</p>

<h2>Very active on instagram</h2>
<p>
	First thing we noticed was that the organization was very active on Instagram. In fact, most of
	the donations they used to get were coming from there. They usually posted content of high
	quality, and knew how to engage with their community which was a truly good point.
</p>

<h2>Transparency at the heart of the communication</h2>
<p>
	Another key aspect of For Al Aytaam that we pointed out, is that they valued transparency. Through
	their communications on Instagram they were always showing their entire process: going on site to
	exchange with the people working in the orphanages, showing pictures of the children, sharing
	testimonies of children in the orphanages, showing the receipts of what they were able to buy with
	the donations, pictures of what they were able to provide to the orphanages with the donations,
	etc.
</p>

<h2>An organization that is present in many countries</h2>
<p>
	Last but not least, we discovered that the organization has worked in many countries and not
	remotely, they always visit every orphanage that they help. For Al Aytaam had worked in a dozen of
	countries when we started this project: France, Ghana, Columbia, Mexico, Portugal, Morocco,
	Mexico, Guinea, Thailand, etc. We thought it was important to highlight that in the future
	website.

<p class="inter-title">The design process</p>
<h2>Setting a direction</h2>
<p>
	From the analysis that we made, we wanted to put the emphasis on the key points we discovered:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>transparency and trust</li>
	<li>international presence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A campaign page</h2>
<p>
	An interesting thing that I noticed, is that the organization never manages multiple projects at
	the same time. Usually they have a project and they try to raise as much money for it, once it is
	over they start another one. So it is very similar to how campaigns work.
	<br />
	That's how I had the idea to create a campaign page. For this I assumed I would go for a card
	design for each campaign and add some sort of gamification with progress bars and numbers. This is
	a simple way to present the information and it is easily understadable by the users. Just with a
	glimpse they can see which project are funded and which are currently funding, they can also see
	which need more money and which don't.
</p>

<h2>An interactive map on the home page</h2>
<p>
	The first idea that came to us was to put an interactive map right at the top of the home page to
	show that For Al Aytaam is very active. A map that would contain pins (in the form of the logo)
	everywhere they helped an orphanage.
</p>

	alt="Early sketch of the home page, showing the interactive map at the top"
/>
<p class="subhead">Early sketch of the home page</p>

<h2>Key numbers on the home page</h2>
<p>
	As you can see in the example above, there is also a banner containing the statistics of the
	organization, that are supposed to change as new projects are funded. I noticed that usually the
	types of help they give are always the same: health kits, school supplies, clothes, food and help
	in building. Displaying this on the home page can really speak for itself, it gives the visitors
	concrete numbers about what <em>For Al Aytaam</em> does.
</p>
<p>Also, we all like to see some data and numbers!</p>

	src="/images/foralaytaam/foralaytaam-map.png"
	alt="Example of an interactive map with pins that could be used on the home page"
/>
<p class="subhead">Example of an interactive map that could be used on home page</p>

<p>
	Soon enough, we realized that seeing an interactive map directly on the home page, without any
	explanation, would not be the best idea for a user, especially a first-time visitor. We didn't
	really have target users to test it with, but we still tested early versions of the wireframes to
	see what a first time visitor might think, and it revealed that the map at the top of the home
	page was not the best idea.
</p>
<p>
	We still thought that this map could be reused somewhere else on the website to better convey that
	the organization has helped in a lot of different places. It would also serve as a simpler way to
	browse through the campaigns.
</p>

<h2>A home page as a summary of all the content available on the website</h2>

	alt="Higher fidelity wireframe of the home page"

<p class="subhead">Higher fidelity wireframe of the home page</p>

<p>
	The main intention behind this design is to have a home page giving you an overview of what you
	can find on the website, it invites you to consult the other sections and pages.
</p>

<p>We decided to split the website in these 3 main sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a campaign page</li>
	<li>a testimonial page where we can find testimonials of orphans and orphanage workers</li>
	<li>an event page</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The brief description would contain a link redirecting to "About us", the last campaign would
	redirect to the campaign page and the last testimonial would redirect to the testimonial page.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually we decided to drop the event section as they did not plan to do a lot of them and it
	was useless to have an empty section on the website.
</p>

<p>We ran a few tests with users we could find and refined the design accordingly.</p>

	Once this was validated by the client, we went a little deeper in the UI and I developed the
	website using Wordpress as a CMS.

<p class="inter-title">The lessons</p>
<h2>What I would change if I had to do it again</h2>
<p>
	I have learned a lot since them, in terms of design and development. Even though the design was
	not on point, the part I am the most dissatisfied with today is the development.
	<br />
	I tried my best to develop a website usable by non programmers but I had not taken into account
	that people are given a lot of liberty on Wordpress, in terms of colors, typography and
	functionalities such as adding buttons etc. The problem is I was not aware of that in the past, it
	was the very first time I developed a website with Wordpress and since then, people of the
	organization have changed a lot of things without respecting the graphical identity of the
	organization.
	<br />
	It was my job as the developer to make it so that it always fits to the identity, to restrict what
	the users can do, if I had to do it again I would have spend more time on this part.
